## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixed

### Issue: DMCA Reports Schema Constraint Error
**Problem:**  
- `POST /api/reports/dmca` was failing with "NOT NULL constraint failed: dmca_reports.content_url"
- Reports without a `contentUrl` field could not be submitted
- Database schema had incorrect NOT NULL constraint

**Root Cause:**  
- The `dmca_reports` table was created with a NOT NULL constraint on `content_url`
- Schema definition in `src/db/schema.ts` showed it as nullable, but database had wrong constraint

**Solution:**  
1. Created migration script to recreate table with correct schema
2. Made `content_url` properly nullable in database
3. Preserved all existing data during migration
4. Verified fix with comprehensive tests

**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - System was blocking valid DMCA submissions

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All DMCA submissions now work correctly
